Firebase data manipulation
==========================

All of our data is available through a REST API, so you could easily write a script to do this yourself. You can export the data by setting format=export (this includes all of the priority data in the response):

curl https://myapp.firebaseIO.com/.json?format=export&auth=YOUR_FIREBASE_SECRET
As for exporting the security rules, you can access them here:

curl https://myapp.firebaseIO.com/.settings/rules/.json?auth=YOUR_FIREBASE_SECRET
You can then write them back to the new Firebase using PUT.

The various Auth settings can't easily be automatically transferred (such as the Authorized Origins), but they probably shouldn't be as they'll differ between staging and production.
